This code beats the opponent in the game of Rock Paper Scissors by predicting the opponents move using the history of moves played and analyzing this data.

This agent tries to beat the opponent player using the data from the game history and analyzing it. This project stores a history of the moves played and result of each game played. This code then analyses the opponent moves from the games already played and finds out the probability of the occurrence of the opponent moves(i.e. rock or paper or scissors) and throws a move which beats the identified opponent's move.
